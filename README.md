# Tic Tac Toe

#### Project 4

###### This is my fourth of twelve projects for the Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

A fun game of Tic-Tac-Toe written in pure JavaScript, no plugins or jQuery.

I have expanded the project by adding the following features:
* The starting player is chosen randomly
* Player-O has to enter his name before the game can begin
* Player's name appears on the board screen
* Player vs. computer. One side of the game is programmatically controlled
* Player's name appears if they win
